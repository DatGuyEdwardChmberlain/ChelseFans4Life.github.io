<p class="center">Chelsea stunned Man City as they lost their first game of the season despite Guardiola saying they were fantastic.It was the first time Man City lost a league game in 21 matches and a first away game in 14.Last season's centurions paid the price for the lack of ruthlesness in front of goal and Chelsea hit City on the break as Kante fired the ball into the roof of the net past Ederson.Chelsea gained momentum and started to dominate the second half and David Luiz headed the ball in from a corner to give Chelsea the three points.Sarri made four changes after Wednesday's 2-1 shocking defeat to Wolves with Pedro,Kovacic,Jorginho and David Luiz replacing Morata who suffered a knee injury,Loftus-Cheek,Fabregas and Christensen and did not play a striker for the first time this season with Eden Hazard opertaing as a false nine as he had done under previous manager Antonio Conte.Man City dominated the first 44 minutes with Sterling missing a crucial chance from twelve yards out which was comfortably saved by Kepa and that that continued his awful record against Chelsea as the englishman has not scored or assisted against us in eight appearanaces.Sane also had some chances as he missed one from close range and one that was crucially blocked by Azpilicueta.After that though Chelsea ended the half with a swift counter attack as David Luiz played a fifty yard pass to Willian who switched the play to Hazard who then set Kante to have a shot.</p>

<p class="center">The goal was a major blow for Man City as Chelseaa gained control of the second half with Willian having a free kick and a shot saved by Ederson.However in the 78th minute Man City felt a decision went against them when Barkley shot but there was the slightest of deflections from Mahrez which City felt there was no deflection.The corner was given and David Luiz rose above everyone else to give brething room for Chelsea against last season's champions.Man City however did get a chance at the end when Kepa missed place a pass but recovered to save Gabriel Jesus's shot that was heading in the top right corner.Sarri said he was happy with Chelsea's mentality and we showed desire to win the game.Man City did however miss De Bruyne and Aguero and that appeared to be crucial for them as they played a false nine as well.Guardiola's horrific record continues at Stamford Bridge but Chelsea impressed.Kante proved Sarri's point playing him in a more advanced role worked.The world cup winner was magnificent making key interceptions but also getting into forward positions.Chelsea on Thursday travel to Hungary to play Vidi but their next gae is on the south coast against Brighton.</p>
