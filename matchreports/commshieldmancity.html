 <p class="elem1">Aguero's double helped Man City beat us in the Community Shield in our first competitve match of 2018/19</p>   
     
    
<p class="elem2"><font size="5">Sergio Aguero's brace for Manchester City condemed Chelsea to defeat as he scored his 200th and 201st goals for Manchester City since joining them in 2011.Man City dominated us and were deserved winners with them having more important players than us as some are still coming back from holiday.Aguero scored 13 minutes into each half but however could've had more as we had put in an unconvincing perofrmance.Despite that we enjoyed spells of pressure and our best chance came from teenager Callum Hudson-Odoi who forced a smart save from Bravo who ws again one of the better players since Maurizio Sarri has taken over.On a scorching hot day drink breaks were taken and most players were far away from their best performance.

An unchanged lineup from our game aginst Arsenal last wednesday meant that Caballero started in goal with Rudiger and Davd  Luiz as the two centre backs with three in midfield being Barkley,Fabregas and Jorginho.The wingers were Pedro and Hudson-Odoi with Morata up top.City's first chance came as early as the second minute with Leroy Sane having a low driven shot with his left foot outside the box that hovered wide.Three minutes later new signing for Man City Riyad Mahrez had a free kick that hit the wall.Their first goal came in the thirteenth minute where youngster Phil Foden played a pass to Aguero and Aguero placed the ball in the bottom right corner from sixteen yards.The goal could've been avoided as Rudiger gave him space to take a touch and shoot.Our first half chance came from a setpiece in the sixteenth minute where Fabregas stroke a lofted set piece that was punched away by Man City goalkeeper Bravo.City then had a good chance midway through the first half to extend their led as Leroy Sane could've been one on one with Caballero but aa heavy touch took the ball away from him.Morata then cut inside outside the box and tamely shot wide.Callum Hudson-Odoi then had a deflected shot that forced an uncomfortble save from Bravo on the half hour mark.Then in added time of the first half the ball bounced over Bravo but Morata now wearing the number 29 shirt was unable to keep the ball in play.Five minutes into the second half Aguero had a glorious chance to make it 2-0 as he went around Chelsea goalkeeper Caballero but his shot had hit the side netting.However eight inutes later he managed to convert the shot into the net as Bernardo Silva played a pass and he then tucked it into the bottom right corner with hi right foot.In the sixty-fifth minute Riyad Mahrez had a shot from outside the box tht went low and skimmed the post.Wily Caballero denied Aguero a hat-rick as he tipped over his header from the corner.He remained the busier keeper for much of the match.Sarri made changes in the second half with Drinkwater,Abraham,Moses and Willian all coming on.With time almost up, we nearly snatched a consolation after Barkley, arguably our best outfield performer, broke down the right and squared towards sub Tammy Abraham.He and Bravo collided and Moses was unale to convert home a loose,spinning ball.

Caballero saved from Diaz in injury time and then with City trying to walk the ball in, Rudiger somehow diverted Jesus' goalbound effort wide with virtually the last touch
Not the best of performances but it will take time for us to get used to Sarri's system.We have been inactive in the transfer window but money will be spent in the coming days before it shuts on Thursday.A new striker will be required as Morata did not show that he wanted the ball.Davd Luiz did not look comfortable in this system as he was chasing shdows most of the game.Most players were not confident enough and Sarri has a lot of work to do before the Premier League season starts next Saturday in which we play Huddersfield away from home.</font></p>
