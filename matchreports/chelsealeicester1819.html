<p class="center">Chelsea suffered another shock defeat to Leicester as they were not able to score against a resolute Leicester.Manager Maurizio Sarri said that his players reacted with "mental confusion".It was Chelsea's first home defeat however it was their third defeat in six games after going the first twelve games of the season unbeaten.Sarri also said "Chelsea have got no chance of catching up Liverpool and Man City and admitted Chelsea's title hopes are over" as they trail Liverpool by 11 points and it means we are now level on points with Arsenal who are fifth in the battle for fourth place.Chelsea dominated the first half with Hazard who was looking for his 100th Chelsea goal hit the bar after an error from Maguire.Leicester were able to cope with the pressure and defended well.In the second half out of nowhere Maddison of Leicester played a through ball to Jamie Vardy who smashed it into the net and Chelsea were shocked.Chelsea then started to become sloppy as Vardy could've scored another goal as Kepa splt a cross but Vardy tried to backheel it in yet Azpilicueta blocked the shot.Chelsea didn't really seem to respond until the last few minutes where Rudiger headed a free header wide and moments later Alonso was played clean through but the spaniard hit the outside of the post.</p>

<p class="center">It was not a good performance from Chelsea and failed to break down Leicester's defence and it was not the first time this season in which Chelsea have found it very difficult to create chances against lower ranked oppoitions.Sarri again played a false nine which I think was the wrong decsion as in these kind of games we do not need a striker with pace as we will not be playing counter attacking football and I think Giroud should've started as he is a target man and then have some pace on both flanks to get behind the defence.However the centre forward position needs to be addressed with the January trnsfer window comping up as Morata is simply not good enough and Giroud doesnt score enough goals which means we rely too much on Hazard.However Sarri said "Chelsea had bad luck" but there was a lack of intensity in parts of the second half.Chelsea play Watford next on boxing day.</p>
