<p class="center">Chelsea battered Burnley despite the loss of star man Eden Hazard who was out because of a back injury.Ross Barkley and Willan were the impressive ones who more than made up for Hazard's loss.Sarri at end of the match said "Barkley was a complete player" who got a goal and two assists who helped Chelsea move to second in the premier league and maintain their unbeaten start to the season.He has been a player reborn since Sarri arrived in July, earning an England recall and scoring in three consecutive Premier League games, the first Englishman to do so since Frank Lampard in February 2013.

"Barkley is doing very well in this period," said Sarri. "He improved in the defensive phase, improved very much. He improved his physical condition because the last season for him was really very difficult.

"He's a very good player from the technical point of view. Now I think Ross is complete".Chelsea enjoyed the opening twenty minutes with almost 70% possesion as Burnley started the game with energy and intensity but as Barkley played a lovely ball to Morata who slotted it home for his third goal in 3 games Burnley started to drop their standard and their defensive discipline as they were known last year for being rock solid at the back but it was the complete opposite today.Morata could'vescored another two earlier as in the twelth minute he had a header tipped over by Hart and he dragged a shot wide moments later.Chelsea's second goal came in the 57th minute from Barkley who drove his shot low into the bottom right corner.Willian added a third as he curled a shot into the same corner from the edge of the penalty area.Finally Loftus-Cheek wrapped up the win in dded time to give him the perfect week as he scored a hat-rick in the europa league on Thursday.</p>

<p class="center">Sarri had another injury as Pedro got injured in the 30th minute and was replaced by Loftus-Cheek to get some valuable game time.Morata also came of for Giroud who was looking for his first goal of the season but was unable to do so as he had a header saved by Hart.Sarri said that it was likely that Hazard will return next week for the game against Crystal Palace.Overall for Chelsea it was a great performance but Burnley made it far too easy for us and there will be bigger tests in the coming weeks however Burnley did show plenty of fight.</p>
