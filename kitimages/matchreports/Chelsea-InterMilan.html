<img src="images/maxresdefault.jpg" width="500"	height="300" class="elem1">Man of the Match Callum Hudson-Odoi(in yellow on the right)

<p class="elem1"><font size="5">Maurizio Sarri ensured that he won his second game  with Chelsea in his second game in charge.Willy Caballero saved Milan Skriniar's penalty to make sure that Chelsea won the penalty shootout.The Italian stuck with the exact same lineup that started the last match against Perth Glory.Chelsea started the game sharply with them even having a good chance in the second minue with Samir Handanovic saving Ross Barkley's shot through a tight angle.They then straight after scored a goal that was scored by Morata through his head that was ruled out for offside but that decision was debatable.In the eigth minute Chelsea got rewarded a goal that was tapped in by Pedro and that was a nice birthday present as he was celebrating his 31st birthday.After Marcos Alonso had curled a free-kick just over the bar we passed up a decent opportunity on the break to extend our advantage.

Inter Milan's first oppurtunity was a powerful shot from Candreva that went wide but Icardi who was left out the world cup and was the joint to Calcio A goal scorer tried to get a touch on the shot but was unable to do so.

Morata had a good hance to double the lead as he was one on one with the defender but blasted a left footed shot wide from just outside the area.

The Italians then had their second good chance to draw lead ten minutes before half-time as Candreva hit a low cross and Icardi left it for Politano but Poliatano had hit his shot past the post.Later on Chelsea missed a number of chances and had to pay the price as Inter Milan scored early on in the second half.The Second Half became a much more even game as Inter Milan we attacking Chelsea with a lot of men.Danny Drinkwater hit a long strike that just skipped past the post in an attempt to score.

Hudson-Odoi then did brilliantly to skip beyond his man before standing a cross up to the back post where it was headed behind before Moses could get on the end of it.

The blues had some chances in the last 10 minutes to score a last minute winner but were unable to do so as Jorginho hit a 25 yard deflected strike that was saved by Handanovic.

The match then went to penalties and after Caballero saved from Skriniar, Azpilicueta converted the last penalty that handed the win to Chelsea.But having that said Chelsea won the game on penalties.Most people will put it that Chelsea played well missing a number of chances.
The star performers were 17 year old winger Callum Hudson-Odoi as he was quick and was leaving Inter's defenders bamboozled with his cheeky skills.He was equally as good with his left and right foot.Also new signing Jorginho impressed with his range of passing and he was picking up the ball deep and starting attacks.However the poor performers were bakayoko who kept giving the ball away cheaply like last seson and Morata who's finishing was very poor.Morata who has been linked with a move away from Chelsea might have to make way for Higuain.Morata has played poor and might mentally not be up for it to play for Chelsea.
Chelsea will have to get used to the system of Sarri and it will take time but some encourging things are being seen.Chelsea travel next to Dublin to face Arsenal in the same competion and will compete against their London rivals who also have a new manager-Unai Emery.</p>
