<p class="center">Wolves stunned Chelsea as two goals in four second half minutes were enough to beat Chelsea.However there was a big moment in the game where Chelsea should've had a penalty as Loftus-Cheek crossed the ball into Morata's path who had an open goal but Wolves defender Boly slid in from behind and should've been sent off.Chelsea suffered back to back away defeats despite dominating but this means we are now level on points with Arsenal in the quest to fight for the top four.We had 70% possesion and 17 shots on goal which meant we lacked a cutting edge in front of goal.Sarri at the end of the match was baffled by how Chelsea lost the game and what went wrong and it was one of those days where it didn't go our way.Sarri made five changes to the side that beat Fulham on Sataurday with Christensen and Fabregas coming in for David Luiz and Jorginho who being rested as Sarri had Saturday's crucial game against Man City and the festive period in mind.Also Loftus-Cheek,Willian and Morata came in for Kovacic,Pedro and Giroud who were all dropped to the bench.Chelsea took the lead in the eighteenth minute through a deflected Loftus-Cheek strike which was headed in by Wolves Captain Connor Coady but the goal was given to Loftus-Cheek rather than an on goal as Loftus-Cheek's shot was heading on target.Chelsea could've extended the lead after the goal with Willian having a free kick tipped over and shot from Kante that was struck wide.This was a turning point as a fine run from teenager Gibbs-White passed it to Jimenez who scored a low strike but questions could be asked as Chelsea keeper Kepa could've saved it.Shortly after Doherty hit a low cross which was met by Diogo Jota to score his first league goal of the season.</p>

<p class="center">Moutinho for Wolves could've been sent off as he was cautioned for a foul on Hazard and should've got a second two minutes later for a foul on Loftus-Cheek.For Morata, preferred up front ahead of Olivier Giroud, it was another unconvincing performance with him wasting his only chance - shooting over from 25 yards after only 11 minutes.There were other chances as had Hazard hit a shot off target and Fabregas also hit one over the bar.Wolves held on and their spirit and desire was enough to again get points against one of the top six teams.We host top of the league Man City on Saturday who are unbeaten in 15 league away matches and that game is now a must win if we are going to ensure that we will play Champions League football next season.It was a good perforamance for the first 55 minutes but the goal but the first Wolves goal changed the complexion of the game and questions might be asked of our mentality.</p>
