<img src="matchreports/rossfirst.jpg" width="500" height="315" class="center">
<p class="center">Chelsea swept Southampton aside and moved to the top of the league until Liverpool play Man City.Southampton who have only one once in their past fourteen home games were below parr again and Chelsea punished them.Sarri made nine changes to the side that beat Vidi on tuesday but he only made a solitary change to the last league game with Barkley replacing Kovacic in the midfield.Giroud made his 200th Premier League appearnce but mostof them not for Chelsea and Rudiger made his 50th appearance in Chelsea blue.The blues were most dominant on the south coast nd deserved the three points.Chelsea's first goal came from Southampton's Hojberg who gave the ball on the edge of the penalty and Barkley set up Hazard for his seventh league goal of the season.The second came from a free kick where Willian teed up Giroud who did an acrobatic kick across the 18 yard box and Ross Barkley was there who tapped in his first goal for Chelsea since arriving from Everton in January.The third came from Chelsea's two touch passing and the ball fell to Morata who chipped it over Mcarthy for his third goal of the season.</p>

<p class="center">Under blue skies and Chelsea who wore their new third kit for the first time enjoyed the ball for the first fifteen minutes of the game.The first chances came as Hazard hit two shots tht were blocked and Willian hit a shot that sailed to hit thhe top of the crossbar.he momentum swung Southampton’s way. Next, on 26 minutes, Redmond released Ryan Bertrand flying down the left and his cross was perfect for Ings, who simply had to score from a few yards out.Instead, he missed one of a few oppurtunites for Southampton.It was a golden oppurtunity.Despite that later Wesley Hodet did well to disposses Hazard,Hojberg the player he passed it got caught on his toes,who quickly returned the ball to Hazard who was unmarked.Twelve yards out and dead centre there was only one possible outcome and Hazard slotted the ball into the net to get his seventh league goal of the season.</p>

<p class="center">A few minutes before the opener Giroud could've won Chelsea a penalty as Hoedt slide tackled Giroud but appeared to have tripped him up.A tug of N’Golo Kante’s shirt by Bertrand was also waved away by the ref as half-time approach. When the French midfielder did get a shot away, it was blocked, a fate that befell nine of our 12 first-half attempts.</p>


<img src="matchreports/hazardsouthampton2.jpg" width="500" height="315" class="center">
<p class="center">Southampton made a substitution during the interval as Bednarek was replaced by ex Chelsea player Oriol Romeu and also switched to a 4-4-2 formation.That didn’t stop Bertrand getting forward and our Champions League winner will feel he should have done better than volley over when found unmarked from a deep cross. Ings then fired straight at Kepa. There was no question the Saints remained a threat.

Willian wasted a chance to feed Hazard when Yoshida miscontrolled, so the cushion of a second goal would have to wait - but not for long.

Hazard was felled flying past Ings and Willian lofted the resulting free-kick to Giroud, who had peeled round the back. He scissor-kicked across the goal and there was Barkley in the right place to finish from close range. The no.8 celebrated his maiden Chelsea strike in front of the equally joyous travelling support who have certainly enjoyed their trips to this stadium of late.It was the first time and Englishman had scored and assisted for Chelsea in the league since Frank Lampard in December 2013.</p>

    <p class="center">The second goal resulted Southampton receiving four bookings in twelve minutes with Hazard receiing some rought reatment during that period.Susbstituions were made as Willian,Giroud and Barkley who starred were replaced by Pedro,Morata and Kovacic.Southampton though still caused threat as Redmond's stinging shot was fingertipped onto the bar by Kepa.Shortly after Morat had a golden oppurtunity to make it 3-0 but was denied by Mcarthy but it was something that Morata has done regularly in 2018.Back down the other end, Kepa sprung to his left to tip over Ings’ curler. Having been largely untroubled until that point, our keeper had twice shown his worth late on.

There was just enough time for another Chelsea goal, and what a fine one it was too. There were consecutive passes aplenty before Hazard burst into space and slipped Morata in behind. The Spaniard coolly beat McCarthy in the third minute of stoppage time.</p>

    <img src="matchreports/2466.jpg" width="500" height="315" class="center">

    <p class="center">Sarri praised Ross Barkley after the game and believed he could do very well for England.Few believed the Chelsea squad would be able to alter their style of play to match Sarri's expectations when the Italian was appointed in July.

But in simple terms, they have flourished. And 'Sarriball' was on show for all to see in the first 15 minutes at St Mary's, as the Blues held 86% of possession.The next game after the international break  where we play Mn Utd who have not played well recently and a familiar freind and foe Jose Mourinho returns</p>
