<p class="center">Chelsea made it two wins out of two in the Premier League under Maurizio Sarri after an entertaining 3-2 victory against Arsenal.The game could've gone either way but we were the team that took our chances better than the gunners.Aubameyang and Mkhitaryan missed glorious chances for Arsenal from twelve yards out.It was a vital three points as this means we now go six points clear of one of our top four rivals.Sarri named an unchanged starting lineup from our 3-0 win against Huddersfield last weekend.Our first goal game in the ninth minute where Alonso hit a low cross from the left hand side and then Pedro tapped the ball in the back of the net.We soon then went 2-0 up where Morata cut inside and placed a left footed shot into the goal.It was Morata's first goal for Chelsea since the FA Cup semi-final against Southampton in April.Chelsea's second goal woke up Arsenal as they started to pile up the pressure on us as Arsenal failed to take a number of chances.They eventually got their prize as Armenian midfielder Henrikh Mkhytariyan scored through a driven shot outside the box which £71 million goalkeeper Kepa should've done a lot better,before Alex Iwobi made it 2-2.Chelsea started to dominate in the second half as most of the game was being played in Arsenal's half.In the eighty first minute substitute Eden Hazard produced a moment of magic as he dribbled around some Arsenal defenders before he found Alonso who tapped in the winner for Chelsea.It was a game with some awful defending and Arsenal were the team tht let themselves down more with their defending.</p>

<p class="center">Morata scores his first goal under Maurizio Sarri</p>

<p class="center">The first chance of the game was Chelsea's in the third minute where Pedro curled a left footed shot wide from outside the box.Five minutes later Arsenal came close when Ozil volleyed Monreal's cross narrowly wide.A minute later Arsenal's high line got caught out when Jorginho played a pass through to Alonso and wa able to find Pedro who put Chelsea 1-0 up.Soon after Kante found Barkley who blasted the ball over the bar.As Arsenal were looking for an equalider they nearly got it when Bellerin ran a cross ad squared it to Aubameyang who missed from six yards out.Arsenal's high line again got exposed when Azpilcueta played Morata through who cut inside and placed the ball into the net.Mkhitaryan then wasted a similar oppurtunity to Aubameyang's.Arsenal  mounted the pressure on us and were playing a high intensity game and in the thirty seventh minute Mkhitaryan pulled one back for Arsenal but our record signing Kepa got beaten at his near post.However Morata came close straight after as Arsenal goalkeeper Cech tipped his shot over the bar.Iwobi then got the equaliser where he duly tapped in Mkhitaryan's pass.The second half Chelsea started to dominate however there was more defensive stability from Arsenal as Torreira provided that better thaan Xhaka who came off.The first chance in the second half was Chelsea's where Kante was unpressurized in the eighteen ard box but Sokratis managed to lock his shot.Soon after Barkley managed to turn around and hit  shot that was well saved by Cech.In the sixtieth minute substitutions were made as Barkley and Wllian came off for Hazard and Kovacic who was making his debut since arriving from Real Madrid on loan.He made a good first impresson as he looked lively and was moving forward with the ball positively.Arsenl hd a chance to take he lead where Kepa spilt Bellerin's cross but managed to recover.In the eighty first minute our star player Eden Hazard produced a moment of magic to find Alonso who got the winner for Chelsea.The goal meant Alonso has scored against Arsenal in the premier league twice in a row.Chelsea could've had another goal in injury time where Hazard played it to Giroud who was one on one with Cech but the goalkeeper managed to keep the ball out of the net.The win means Chelsea have two wins out of two under Sarri and we go six points clear of Arsenal as we condemed them to a second consecutive defeat.</p>

    <p class="center">Marcos Alonso's winner against Arsenal</p>

    <p class="center">But, despite the victory, coach Maurizio Sarri said "he did not believe his players were ready to challenge for Manchester City's title.

I enjoyed the match for 75 minutes," he said. "The other 15 minutes it was better to smoke, I think. It was a wonderful match for everybody but those 15 minutes were horrible.

At the moment we are not ready. We need to improve and I hope that, in two months' time, we will be able to play 90 minutes like we did in the first 25 today."In the game we saw the best and worst of Chelsea.We were lucky that Arsenal missed a number of chances and they could've all been avoided as we gave their attackers to much space.Arsenal were splitting our defence open too many times.Its fair to say that there were positives as Jorginho had a pass completion of 91.9% and completed 99 passes more than anyone in the whole match.Alvaro Morata also got on the scoresheet which will also boost his confidence.If we can work on our defending we could do very well this season however we are still trying to get used to Sarri's system.Despite that next week we travel to Newcastle who have picked up one point from their first two games.</p>
