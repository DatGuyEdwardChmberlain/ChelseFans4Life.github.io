<p class="center" class="elem3">Chelsea started the Premier League season with a dominant perforance against a physical Hudderfield side as the scoreline did not suggest how the game went. Huddersfield would've felt that they were unlucky not to have scored.It was Maurizio Sarri's first Premier League game in charge of us and he said after the game that "our quality rather than tactical organisation were key to beating Huddersfield 3-0.Sarri gave a debut to our record signing Kepa Arrizabalaga in goal and started with Azpilicueta(who captained the team),Rudiger,David Luiz and Alonso and that was our back four.The three in midfield were Jorginho,Kante and Barkley.Pedro aand Willian played on the wing and Morata played up top.Sarri, who became the club's 10th full-time manager in 10 years after Conte was sacked in the summer, saw Chelsea take the lead with their first shot on target.World Cup winner Ngolo Kante opened up the scoring in the thirty fourth minute with a mis hit vollley that bounced into the bottom left corner through a cross played by Willian.Eleven minutes later Alonso was brought down in the Huddersfield penalty error by a late challenge by Schindler after a wonderful flick by Ross Barkley.Jorginho then converted it and that meant he has scored 10 out of his 11 penalties in Europe's top five leagues.Chelsea with ten minutes to go wrapped the game up as Eden Hazard who was strongly linked with Real Madrid in the summer played a pass to Pedro who slotted the ball in the bottom left corner with composed finish.</p>

<p class="center">Jorginho scores his penalty on his Premier League debut into the right side of the net.</p>

<p class="center">Our first chance came in the third minute where Huddersfield goalkeeper Hamer made a carless pass and Pedro took advantage of that.He then found Morata whose shot was wide when one on one with Hamer but he was offside anyway.Huddersfield fifteen minutes later got a chance where Alex Pritchard half volleyed a shot but it ended up being a comfortable save for Kepa.After Pritchard thought he should'vehad a penalty after being held by David Luiz.Three minutes later Billing hit a stinging half volley from thirty yards out that was inches over the bar.Then came Kante's goal where Willian beat the right back and blasted a cross where Kante scuffed a volley that was not meant to go where he originally aimed it.Despite going behind Huddersfield were piling the pressure on us and had their best chance of the game through a corner where Jorgensen flicked it to Mounie where he had a free header from the six yard box but hit the post.Just before half time a good build up of play from Chelsea opened up Hudersfield and Alonso won a penalty after a clumsy challenge from schindler.Jorginho then put the penalty away.In thehe second half Chelsea started to gain dominance.Our first chance came seven minutes into the second half where Morata was not able to get a touch on a delicous cross from Azpilicueta.On the hour mark Willian fired a shot that was wide from outside the box.Four minutes lter Alonso cae close fro a free kick that was whiskers over the bar.Two changes were then made as Barkely and Willian made way for Loftus-Cheek and Eden Hazard. With ten minutes to go Hazard played a pass to Pedro who passed the ball into the bottom left corner.</p>

<p class="center">Kepa made his debut in goal today</p>

<p class="center">Huddersfield manager after the game said that the Terrier were beaten by quality.The West Yorkshire side fought hard for the first forty minutes nd might have felt they should have had a goal.However Chelsea were ruthless in the first half and that was the difference between the two sides.Jorginho on his first Premier League game played exceptional as he completed 62 out of his 66 passes.That was the most completed out of anyone during the game.Kante also impressed even though he played n the left side o the midfield three.Our record signing Kepa had nothing much to do apart from three kicks and a comfortable save.Having that said we can really say if we're heading on the right track if we beat Arsenal next Saturday in Sarri's first Premier League game at Stamford Bridge.</p>
