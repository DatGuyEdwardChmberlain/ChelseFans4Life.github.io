<p class="center">A late own goal meant that Sarri maintained his 100% win record with Chelsea in the premier league and ensured he was the 5th Chelsea manager to do so.The result meant that Chelsea go second in the league and that Chelsea have won at St James' Park for the first time since 2011.It was a frustrating performance as Newcastle sat deep and it  was difficult for us to break them down.Sarri made two changes to the lineup that started against Arsenal as Eden Hazard who captained Belgium to third place at the World Cup and Mateo Kovacic who was part of the Croatian team that were runners up in the World Cup made his full debut as they both came in for Willian and Ross Barkley.Eden Hazard on his first start made the breakthrough after Marcos Alonso who got the winner last week against Arsenal was fouled in the penalty area.Six minutes later Joselu headed Newcastle level however there was a foul in the build up of play as Giroud appeared to have been elbowed in the face by DeAndre Yedlin.Despite that Chelsea had some fortune in the last goal as Marcos Alonso hit a half volley and Yedlin got a touch on its way into the goal.A three well deserved points providing our dominance of 81% of the possesion.</p>

<p class="center">Sarri in his press conference after the game said he was very surprised with the way Newcastle setup.Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez complained afer he was missing star players Jamal Lascelles and Jonjo Shelvey through to Chelsea.He was also missing Kenedy as he was ineligble to play against his parent club.</p>

<p class="center">Twinkle toed Eden Hazard who declared he was 200% to play before the game got the first kick of the game in the achilles but Chelsea failed to take advantage fom the free kick.The first chance came to Newcastle where Josh Murphy forced a save from Kepa. Cesar Azpilicueta soon after,on the occasion of his 200th Premier League game, came close to teeing up Alvaro Morata in front of goal with a ball slid across the wet turf, but that was about it.Rudiger then poked a shot wide from after the Geordies made hard work of the corner.Possesion was dominated by Chelsea with neat touches but we were stuggling to create clear cut chances with Hazard's curled shot our only good chance midway through the first half.Later a some swift dribbling from Hazard was a chance but he was prevented by firing a shot from a nasty challenge from Diame.</p>

<p class="center">In the 32nd minute Newastle's best chance came from Salomon Rondon's free header from an undealt with free kick.Shortly after Hazard again found his way through around some Newcastle defenders and set up Pedro from fifteen yards but Pedro's shot was tamely struck and was saved comfortably by Dubravka.A quick ball out to Pedro from Hazard after he had spotted the Spaniard’s run did open up space early in the second half but Azpilicueta’s subsequent shot was saved. Down that same flank, Jorginho and Azpi exchanged passes and the ball was threaded through to Morata but his touch was too strong and the chance to shoot escaped.</p>

<p class="center">After the interval Newcastle continued to keep plenty of men behind the ball and were trying to hold on to a 0-0 draw.</p>

<p class="center">A quick ball out to Pedro from Hazard after he had spotted the Spaniard’s run did open up space early in the second half but Azpilicueta’s subsequent shot was saved. Down that same flank, Jorginho and Azpi exchanged passes and the ball was threaded through to Morata but his touch was too strong and the chance to shoot escapedNewcastle continued to hinder us from scoring and the referee was now starting to draw yellow cards out from his pocket.As thta happened Giroud came on for Morata and shortly after Willian came on for Pedro.</p>

<p class="center">Five minutes later Rudiger released a rocket that hit the crossbar from thrity yards out and that was the closest Chelsea had come.Fortunately we were not left to rue that escape for our opponents long. A ball played forward quickly from the back meant more space than normal down our left and from Hazard's pass, Alonso was able to attack in the box. He initially eased his way past Schar whose attempted recovery tackle went through our left-back’s legs and tripped him. Penalty whistled referee Paul Tierney. Hazard did the rest with powerful dispatch to Martin Dubravka’s right.</p>

<p class="center">However our lead only lasted six minutes as Joselu skipped away past David Luiz to head in Yedlin's cross.There was some contorvesy in the goal though as Newcastle wing back DeAndre Yedlin appeared to have elbowed Giroud in the face in the buld up to the goal.</p>

<p class="center">There was still time for Chelsea to grab a winner and they did just that as Alonsodrilled a shot that was going wide from a set piece but Yedlin for Newcastle poked it in his own net.</p>

<p class="center">It was a frustrating performance but the full backs did not create enough width for us today and it was very easy for Newcastle.David Luiz also for Newcastle's goal was ball watching as the ball came in and maybe it is time for him to make way for Andreas Christensen.However Jorginho made 21 passes more than the whole Newcastle team making 158. Our two goals were fourtunate but a win is a win and it takes us up to second place because Liverpool have a better goal difference than us.Many positie things and hopefully we can get another win next week against Bournemouth next week at Stmford Bridge.</p>
