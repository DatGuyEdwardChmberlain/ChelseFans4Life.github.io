<p class="elem1">Watch Star Peformer Hudson-Odoi against Arsenal</p>      
    
<p class="elem2"><font size="5">Chelsea lost their first game under Maurizo Sarri on penlties as Chelsea were not able to hold on to their lead as Alexandre Lacazette scored with 17 seconds remaining for Arsenal to take the game to penalties as Ruben Loftus-Cheek missed the deciding penalty.Chelsea dominated in the first haf and could have scored three or four goals but only managed to score one.Chelsea got their first chnce in the fourth minute where Callum Hudson-Odoi dribbled past some Arsenal defenders and played a composed cross to  Fabregas who hit a half volley with his left foot outside the box that was tipped over by ex Chelsea legend Petr Cech.From the corner Chelsea took the lead through Rudiger's powerful header into the bottom right corner.Ten minutes later Hudson-Odoi outpaced Bellerin and was brought down in the 18 yard box to give Chelsea a penalty.Morata was not able to convert the penalty that was saved by Petr Cech.Morata then two minutes later had a free header but was unable to get a touch on the ball.In the 23rd minute again Morata missed a good chance when he was played clear through on goal by Hudson-Odoi had his shot saved by Cech's leg.Arsenal got their first oppurtunity in the 27th minute as Ozil whipped a long ball into the box and was touched down to Smith-Rowe by Auabameyang but his shot was blasted wide.Arsenal started to dominate but were unable to get a shot on target.However after that Jorginho dinked a ball to  Hudson-Odoi who was by himeslf against Petr Cech but Cech had denied Chelsea once again  and that was the only thing the teenager Hudson-odoi had done wrong in the game.Our first chance in the second half was a deflected shot from Ross Barkley that flew over the bar.Again Rudiger had a free header but as unable to find the net as it skipped past the right post.Soon after Mkhitariyan for Arsenal hit a low shot outside the box that was held comfortably by Caballero.Arsenal's best chance yet had come ten minutes later where Iwobi shot from ten yards and 18 year old keeper Bulka got down quickly to save it.However with 17 seconds left Lacazette tpped in Nelson's low cross.All five penalties were converted from each side and the shootout went to suddern death where Loftus-Cheek missed and Iwobi scored the deciding spot kick.A good peformance despite defeat on penalties where in reality it would've been a draw.Chelsea's weakest spot is the striker's position as Morata is just not able to finish his chances which can cost your team the game.Lewandowski and Higuain are potential replacements.Like our other two Pre-Season games we scored within the first ten minutes but missed a host of chances.The same lineup was named like the other two games.With key players not available for the Community Shield as they would be just returning from their holidys after the World Cup such as Hazard,Willian,Kante and Courtois this might be the team that Sarri sticks with for the Community Shield on Sunday against last season's Premier League Champions Manchester City at Wembley..Manager Sarri after the game said he was happy and Rudiger said that Chelsea missed many chances.Hudson-Odoi was Chelsea's star man as he was confusing Bellerin and most of our chances Hudson-Odoi took an importnt part in and was stunning the Dublin crowd with his pace and skills.After the game Sarri said he will be a very very strong player.  </font></p>
