<h1 class="center">5 Young Players looking to impress next season</h1>

<img src="https://sm.imgix.net/19/04/tammy-abraham.jpg?w=640&h=480&auto=compress,format&fit=clip" width="300px" height="400px" class="center">
<p class="center"><font size="2">Tammy Abraham scored 25 goals in the Championship last season and is finally hoping to get a chance at Chelsea after successful loan spells at Aston Villa,Swansea and Bristol City.</font></p>

<p class="center"><font size="4">With Chelsea having a two window transfer ban Chelsea will have to turn to the youth and give them a chance as were are known to have one of the best academies in the world but don't end up using it and instead ruining their careers by sending them out on loan.45 players were out on loan last season which is far too much and that number needs to be reduced.We've seen in the past that we have sold world class players for very low prices thinking they are not good because they haven't had a chance such as Mohammed Salah who has now gone to win two golden boots in a row and Kevin De Bruyne who has won back to back titles with Manchester City.However could this finally be the season where we turn to the youth as we have a manager in Frank Lampard who likes to utilise the youth.We have lost Eden Hazard who was our best player for the past seven years which could potentially make the coming eason harder for Chelsea.Despite this these are exciting times for Chelsea because this is a new chapter of the Abramovich era where we will turn from experience to youth.Here we look at five youngsters who will look to break into the first team:</font></p>

<h2 class="center">Tammy Abraham</h2>
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1163716761.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=480%2C320&ssl=1" class="center" width="300px" height="400px">
<p class="center"><font size="4">Now twenty one this could be Tammy's time to shine as he was the second top scorer in the Championship last season and helped Aston Villa get promoted to the premier league.Also he did well with Swansea in the premier league the season before that and before that with Bristol City he scored 21 goals.He has also got a few caps for the England U21 team and he will feel he should be our first choice striker this season as last season we lacked goals from that position and with Hazard being involved in more than half of our goals last season our goals will have to come from somewhere else and Tammy will be looking to provide.He is an aerial threat as well as able to score with both feet and he brings something different to the team.
</font></p>

<h2 class="center">Mason Mount</h2>
<img src="https://london.7a7.info/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mason-Mount-Chelsea-midfielder-signs-five-year-contract.jpg" class="center" width="300px" height="400px">
<p class="center"><font size="4">Mason Mount was considered Derby's biggest influence in them getting to the Play Off final last season and played 35 of Derby's Championship games and scored 8 goals and assisted 8 goals.He was with Lampard last season so they will know each other very well and Mason likes to play in that No.10 role.He had a loan spell with Vitesse Arnhem the season before last and matched his goals scoring tally at Derby there.A free kick specalist and keen dribbler Mount likes to operate as a playmaker and will know Lampard's system very well.With Loftus-Cheek injured until next year could thi be his breakthrough season?</font></p>

<h2 class="center">Fikayo Tomori</h2>
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSko4OzrdRzJ1XRVICgVpkytfK2Tj0qTwAn5rvg6Jm_nr2bh14L" class="center" width="300px" height="400px">
<p class="center"><font size="4">The Canadin born English centre back Fikayo Tomori won the player of the year award last season at Derby and also played under Frank Lampard last season.A quick and towering centre back the Premier League will suit Tomori's style of play.Tomori made 55 appearances last season for Derby in all competitons and kept 11 clean sheets.Before that he had a loan spell with Hull and played for the Chelsea youth team before that.He currently plays for the England u21s and was was part of the u20 England world cup triumph.Now at 21 is it time he gets a chance at Chelsea?</font></p>

<h2 class="center">Billy Gilmour</h2>
<img src="http://bigwnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ccelebritiesfotoNINTCHDBPICT000505396996-e1563445155292.jpg" class="center" width="300px" height="400px">
<p class="center"><font size="4">Billy Gilmour is a Scottish footballer who was playing for the Chelsea under 23s last season and was previously at Rangers where he trained with the first team squad at the age of 15.He is only 18 years old and is a promising talent in the centre of midfield.He has represented Scotland at under 16,17 and 21 level and will hope to play more often for the Chelsea first team instead of being sent on loan.He made his senior debut for Chelsea in the 1-1 draw against Bohemians on the 10th July and impressed in that match so could is he someone to keep an eye on?</font></p>

<h2 class="center">Reece James</h2>
<img src="https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/07/24/10/reecejames080519a-0.jpg?w968" class="center" width="300px" height="400px">
<p class="center"><font size="4">Reece James won Wigan's player of the season award last season 45 appearances in the Championship last season and was playing mainly as a right back which is a position we could potentially strenghten in.He has also represented Chelsea at youth level.At 19 he will be looking to get a first team spot however that might be hindered by an injury he got in the England u20 World Cup and was not able to travel with the squad on the pre-season tour.He is mainly an attacking quick full back and his game is the opposite to our current right back Cesar Azpilicueta.</font></p>

<p class="center"><font size="4">Hopefully we do see these players playing regularly next season and players such as Christensen and Zouma get more game time as they are both now 24 years of age and Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi continue to progress once they recover from their long term injuries.Ruben last season was one of our better players but yet still wasn't get the game time he should've got.Also Christian Pulisic who is supposed to be a replacement for Eden Hazard will look to make his mark in the Premier league after joining from Borussia Dortmund for Â£58 million.</font>
