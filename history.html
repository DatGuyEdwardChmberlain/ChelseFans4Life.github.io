    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><font size="4">Chelsea Football Club was founded in 1905 and the club's home ground since then has been Stamford Bridge.Chelsea have won 28 major trophies with 23 of them being since 1997.Chelsea won their first Premier eague in 1955 and after 4 trophies being won between 1965 and 1971.Chelsea have won six titles,eight FA Cups,five League Cups,one Champions League,one Europa League,two UEFA Cup Winners Cups and four Community Shields.Chelsea became the first team in London to win the Champions League and no team in England has won the Champions League since Chelsea did in 2012.</font></p>

     <p><font size="4"> In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered. Chelsea were founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook), opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The club won promotion to the First Division in their second season. They reached the 1915 FA Cup Final, where they lost to Sheffield United at Old Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the club's best league campaign to that point. Chelsea attracted large crowds and had a reputation for signing big-name players, but success continued to elude the club in the inter-war years.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Ted Drake the former Arsenal and England centre forward became the manager in 1952 and wanted to modernise the club.He improved the youth and academies,the training facilites,removed the club's pensioner crest,made signings from the lower leagues and led us to our first trophy-which was the League title during the 1954/55 season.The following season the European Champions Cup was created but the FFA persudaed Chelsea to  not participate in the competion. Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table. Drake was sacked in 1961 and replaced by player-coach Tommy Docherty.Dring ocherty's tie Chelsea took their first European honour.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The late 1970s through to the 80s was a turbulent period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club, star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious hooligan element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade.In 1982, Chelsea were, at the nadir of their fortunes, acquired by Ken Bates for the nominal sum of £1, although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home.On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the Third Division for the first time, but in 1983 manager John Neal put together an impressive new team for minimal outlay. Chelsea won the Second Division title in 1983–84 and established themselves in the top division, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988–89.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">After a long-running legal battle,new owner Bates reunited the stadium freehold with the club in 1992 by doing a deal with the banks of the property developers, who had been bankrupted by a market crash Chelsea's form in the new Premier League was unconvincing, although they did reach the 1994 FA Cup Final with Glenn Hoddle. It was not until the appointment of Ruud Gullit as player-manager in 1996 that their fortunes changed.Chelsea started to establish themselves as a successful team as former Dutch legend Gullit added several top international players to the side, as the club won the FA Cup in 1997. Gullit was replaced by Gianluca Vialli, who led the team to victory in the League Cup Final, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final and the UEFA Super Cup in 1998, the FA Cup in 2000 and their first appearance in the UEFA Champions League. Vialli was then sacked in favour of Claudio Ranieri, who guided Chelsea to the 2002 FA Cup Final and Champions League qualification in 2002–03.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In 2003 Russian Billiornaire Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea of Bates for £140 million.Over £100 million was spent on players however Ranieri was unable to deliver any trophies and ws therfore replaced by Portguese manager Jose Mourinho in 2004.Mourinho led Chelsea to three Premier League titles,two league cups and one FA Cup.After a poor start to the 2007-08 season Mourinho was fired and replaced by Avram Grant who led Chelsea to their first UEFA Champions League final but they lost to Manchester United on penalties in that match.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Luiz Felipe Scolari took over from Grant, but was sacked after 7 months following poor results. Guus Hiddink then took over the club on an interim basis while continuing to manage the Russian national football team. Hiddink guided Chelsea to another FA Cup success,after which he left the club to return full time to the Russian managerial position.In 2009-10 Carlo Ancelotti was his sucessor and won the FA Cup and Premier League in the 2009-10 season and Chelsea became the first team to score over 100 goals in the Premier League since 1963.In 2012, caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo led Chelsea to their seventh FA Cup, and their first UEFA Champions League title, beating Bayern Munich 4–3 on penalties,the first London club to win the trophy.In 2013 interim boss Rafael Benitez took over and won the UEFA Europa League and became only the fifth team in the world to win two European trophies in a row and only the second English club to win all three European trophies.In the summer of 2013 Mourinho started his second spell in charge leading Chelsea to League Cup success in March 2015,and their fifth league title two months later.Mourinho was sacked after four months of the following season, with the club having lost 9 of their first 16 games and sitting only one point above the relegation zone.One year later Conte led Chelsea to their sixth league title and set a record of Chelsea becoming the first English club to win 30 out of their 38 games.The next season he won Chelsea's eigth FA Cup but got sacked the same season as Chelsea failed to qualify for the Champions League.Maurzio Sarri has been in charge for the past month.</font></p>




    <h2>Records</h2>

    <p><font size="4">Chelsea's highest appearance-maker is ex-captain Ron Harris, who played in 795 competitive games for the club between 1961 and 1980.The record for a Chelsea goalkeeper is held by Harris's contemporary, Peter Bonetti, who made 729 appearances (1959–79). With 103 caps (101 while at the club), Frank Lampard of England is Chelsea's most capped international player.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Frank Lampard is Chelsea's all-time top goalscorer, with 211 goals in 648 games (2001–2014).Chelsea's biggest scoreline victory was 13-0 against Jeunesse Hautcharage in the UEFA Cup Winners Cup in 1971.Their bigget top filght victory was 8-0 against Wigan in 2010 which was also matcched against Aston Villa in 2012.Chelsea's biggest loss was an 8–1 reverse against Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1953.Officially, Chelsea's highest home attendance is 82,905 for a First Division match against Arsenal on 12 October 1935.The modernisation of Stamford Bridge during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands mean that neither record will be broken for the foreseeable future. The current legal capacity of Stamford Bridge is 41,663.Every starting player in Chelsea's 57 games of the 2013–14 season was a full international.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Chelsea hold the record for the feest goals conceded throughout a premier league seson(15) and the highest number of clean sheets in a premier league season(25)-both records set in the 2004-05 season.They are the first team to score more than 100 goals in a Premier League season.Chelsea hold the record the longest streak of unbeaten matches in the Premier League season(86) which lasted from 20th March 2004 to 26th October 2008 and beat the record held by Liverpool that lasted 63 matches.Chelsea's streak of eleven consecutive away league wins, set between 5 April 2008 and 6 December 2008, is also a record for the English top flight.</font></p>
